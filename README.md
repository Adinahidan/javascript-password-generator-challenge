## Description

The Password Generator is a web application that allows users to generate secure passwords that meet specific criteria.

By clicking the "Generate Password" button, users are presented with a series of prompts to customize their password. They can select the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and choose which character types to include, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The input is validated to ensure that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the  Password Generator generates a password that matches the selected criteria. The generated password is then displayed on the page, making it easily accessible for the user.
